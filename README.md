This workflow will play/pause the focusatwill.com in your Google Chrome
browser.  It will not bring Chrome to the front or activate the focus@will
tab.  It will pop a notification on activation.

Hotkeys are stripped on import, so you'll need to go set what you prefer.  You
can also use the keyword "focus".
