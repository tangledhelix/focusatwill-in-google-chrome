This workflow will control the focusatwill.com tab in your Google Chrome
browser. It will not bring Chrome to the front or activate the focus@will tab.

Hotkeys are stripped on import, so you'll need to go set what you prefer. You
may assign hotkeys for the "play/pause" and "next track" actions.

You can use the keyword "focus" (or "foc"). With no argument, play/pause is
assumed.

    foc play    - play/pause
    foc pause   - play/pause
    foc p       - play/pause
    foc pp      - play/pause

    foc next    - next track
    foc skip    - next track
    foc n       - next track

Unfortunately, the new React-based player focus@will has implemented makes it
difficult to switch genres. Without opening the genre list, the genre controls
are not accessible. So for now, the genre selecting feature has been removed.
