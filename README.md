This workflow will control the focusatwill.com tab in your Google Chrome browser. It will not bring Chrome to the front or activate the focus@will tab. If focusatwill.com is not already open, it will be opened.

Hotkeys are stripped on import, so you'll need to go set what you prefer. You may assign hotkeys for the "play/pause" and "next track" actions.

You can use the keyword "focus" (or "foc"). With no argument, play/pause is assumed.

    foc play    - play/pause
    foc pause   - play/pause
    foc p       - play/pause
    foc pp      - play/pause
    
    foc next    - next track
    foc skip    - next track
    foc n       - next track

You can also switch genres using the "focg" keyword. Unfortunately it does not seem to be possible to read data from a rendered web page into Alfred, so the list is fixed. If the site is updated, the list in this workflow will need manual updating.

To change genres, use the "focg" keyword and start typing part of a genre name, such as "alph" for Alpha Chill.
