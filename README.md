This workflow will control the focusatwill.com in your Google Chrome
browser. It will not bring Chrome to the front or activate the focus@will tab.
If focusatwill.com is not already open, it will be opened.

Hotkeys are stripped on import, so you'll need to go set what you prefer.
You may assign hotkeys for the "play/pause" and "next track" actions.

You can use the keyword "focus" (or "foc"). With no argument, play/pause is
assumed.

    focus play    - play/pause
    focus pause   - play/pause
    focus p       - play/pause
    focus pp      - play/pause
    
    focus next    - next track
    focus skip    - next track
    focus n       - next track
